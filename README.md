# the-office-manager

This project is a tribute to one of my favorite television shows, The Office. This show contains so many iconic characters and qoutes that I felt inspired to create a project that allows users to view the characters and their related quotes. 

The goal of the office manager project is to provide practice with fullstack web development and the MVC design pattern.
